<br>and team B contain drain [35, 10, 30, 20, 90]

then team A would be [40, 20, 35, 50, 100] and result would print as <b>Win</b>

run <b>php artisan play:game</b> command

It will ask two questions
<br><b>Enter Team A Players Drain:</b> (you need to enter 5 players drain comma seperated eg.35, 100, 20, 50, 40)
<br><b>Enter Team B Players Drain:</b> (you need to enter 5 players drain comma seperated eg.40, 20, 35, 50, 100)

On basis of drain and algorithm result for team A would display i.e. <b>Win</b> or <b>Lose</b>
